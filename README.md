# Fixed Frequency Signal Generator
## Abstract
A basic signal generator that generates the 4 fundamental waveforms (Square, Sine, Triangular and Sawtooth). The generator was built using only passive components (resistors and capacitors) and operational amplifiers. The generator has a fixed frequency (phase locked) at 1 kHz.

There are 2 files containing the circut. The first one: 'multi-wave-osc' is the basic 'default' circuit built with LTspice's Universal Opamp 2 components. The second one 'multi-wave-sc-lt1364' is the 'main' circuit for testing and prototyping. Fundamentally, they are the same circuit but with some minor differences to account for the behavior of the op-amps used.
